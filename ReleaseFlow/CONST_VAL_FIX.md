# ‚úÖ Const Val List Error Fixed!

## Error
```
Const 'val' has type 'kotlin.collections.List<kotlin.Int>'. 
Only primitive types and 'String' are allowed.
```

## Problem
In Kotlin, `const val` can only be used with:
- Primitive types (Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, etc.)
- String
- **NOT** with collections like List, Set, Map

We were trying to use `const val` with Lists in the Notification object.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

Changed `const val` to `val` for the List constants in `Constants.kt`:

### Changed in `core/domain/.../Constants.kt`:

**Before:**
```kotlin
object Notification {
    const val RELEASE_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(30, 14, 7, 3, 1)  // ‚ùå Error
    const val TASK_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(3, 1)                // ‚ùå Error
    const val UPLOAD_DEADLINE_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(7, 3, 1)  // ‚ùå Error
    const val CHANNEL_ID_RELEASES = "releases"
    const val CHANNEL_ID_TASKS = "tasks"
    const val CHANNEL_ID_INSIGHTS = "insights"
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
object Notification {
    val RELEASE_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(30, 14, 7, 3, 1)  // ‚úÖ Fixed
    val TASK_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(3, 1)                // ‚úÖ Fixed
    val UPLOAD_DEADLINE_REMINDER_DAYS = listOf(7, 3, 1)  // ‚úÖ Fixed
    const val CHANNEL_ID_RELEASES = "releases"
    const val CHANNEL_ID_TASKS = "tasks"
    const val CHANNEL_ID_INSIGHTS = "insights"
}
```

## Why This Works

- `val` (without `const`) can hold any type including collections
- The values are still immutable and accessible as constants
- They're initialized at object creation time
- No runtime performance difference for this use case
